# is under /content/slides/ or not.

# :r! getimg %s https://unsplash.com/photos/Dm974WDaErc/download?force=true

# :r! getimg %s https://unsplash.com/photos/Dm974WDaErc/download?force=true

# strip that suffix out so this will work regardless of where in the Hugo site
# we're located at the moment.
